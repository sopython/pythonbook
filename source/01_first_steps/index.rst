First Steps
===========

Mny operating systems have Python 3 installed. If you're lucky enough to have one, you should be able to execute Python 3 with
``python3`` command in the command prompt / terminal window. Text similar to the following text should be displayed on your terminal.

::

    Python 3.5.2+ (default, Sep 22 2016, 12:18:14) 
    [GCC 6.2.0 20160927] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

The ``>>>`` is a prompt, where Python programming statements can be entered interactively. The first programming construct we use is the :ref:`exit <python:func:exit>`
which exits the interpreter. Type in ``exit()`` and press the enter key:

::

    >>> exit()

You will see that the Python interpreter exits and you have returned back to the command prompt.
